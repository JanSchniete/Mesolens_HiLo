# Mesolens_HiLo
MATLAB script for end-user HiLo microscopy and mesoscopy. Currently tuned for Mesolens data but easily adjustable. Few homebuilt functions are supplied with the script. This script is meant to be used with laser speckle illumination HiLo microscopy but can be used as a starting point to write a script for grid illumination HiLo microscopy.
